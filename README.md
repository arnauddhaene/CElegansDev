This repository contains the relevant code for the ImageJ PlugIn enabling users to approximate surface and volume evolution of C. Elegans embryonic cells over time. It is part of a project for the BIO-410 course @ EPFL.

The repository contains two important folders, [2D](https://github.com/arnauddhaene/CElegansDev/tree/master/2D) and [3D](https://github.com/arnauddhaene/CElegansDev/tree/master/3D). These folders each contain their own `README.md`, where you can find the relevant information for installation and use of the plug-ins. There is also a [extra](https://github.com/arnauddhaene/CElegansDev/tree/master/extra) folder containing an unfinished attempt at using star convex polyhedrons to represent the 3D cell regions.
